<h1>Dosa Recipe</h1>

<h2>Ingredients:</h2>
<ul>
    <li>1 cup rice</li>
    <li>1/4 cup urad dal (split black gram)</li>
    <li>1/4 teaspoon fenugreek seeds (optional)</li>
    <li>1/4 cup poha (flattened rice)</li>
    <li>Water for soaking</li>
    <li>Salt to taste</li>
    <li>Oil or ghee for cooking</li>
</ul>

<h2>Instructions:</h2>

<ol>
    <li>Wash the rice, urad dal, and fenugreek seeds (if using) together under running water until the water runs clear. Place them in a bowl and cover with enough water. Allow them to soak for 4-6 hours or overnight.</li>

    <li>Wash the poha under running water and drain. Add the poha to the soaked rice and dal mixture.</li>

    <li>Drain the soaked mixture and transfer it to a blender or wet grinder. Grind into a smooth batter, adding water as needed. The batter should have a pouring consistency, similar to pancake batter.</li>

    <li>Transfer the batter to a large bowl. Add salt to taste and mix well. Allow the batter to ferment in a warm place for 8-12 hours or until it doubles in volume. Fermentation time may vary depending on the temperature.</li>

    <li>After fermentation, the batter will be bubbly and have a slight sour smell. Mix it gently to combine the batter once again.</li>

    <li>Heat a non-stick dosa pan or griddle over medium-high heat. Once hot, reduce the heat to medium-low.</li>

    <li>Grease the pan lightly with oil or ghee. Take a ladleful of dosa batter and pour it onto the center of the pan.</li>

    <li>Spread the batter in a circular motion from the center outwards to make a thin, even dosa. You can make it as thin or thick as you prefer.</li>

    <li>Drizzle a little oil or ghee around the edges of the dosa and cook until the bottom turns golden brown and crispy.</li>

    <li>Flip the dosa and cook the other side until it's cooked through and lightly browned.</li>

    <li>Remove the dosa from the pan and serve hot with your favorite chutney or sambar.</li>
</ol>
