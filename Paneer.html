<h1>Homemade Paneer Recipe</h1>

<h2>Ingredients:</h2>
<ul>
    <li>1 liter of milk (preferably full-fat)</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons of lemon juice or white vinegar</li>
    <li>Water (for rinsing)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Equipment:</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Heavy-bottomed pan</li>
    <li>Cheesecloth or muslin cloth</li>
    <li>Colander</li>
    <li>Bowl</li>
    <li>Weights or a heavy object (optional)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Instructions:</h2>

<ol>
    <li>Pour the milk into a heavy-bottomed pan and place it on medium heat. Bring the milk to a gentle boil, stirring occasionally to prevent it from sticking to the bottom.</li>

    <li>Once the milk comes to a boil, reduce the heat to low and add the lemon juice or white vinegar. Stir continuously as the milk curdles. You should see the whey (greenish liquid) separate from the curdled milk solids (paneer).</li>

    <li>Turn off the heat as soon as the whey is clear, and the milk solids have completely separated. This usually takes 1-2 minutes. If it doesn't happen, you can add a little more lemon juice or vinegar and stir until separation occurs.</li>

    <li>Place a colander over a large bowl and line it with a double layer of cheesecloth or muslin cloth. This will help strain the whey and collect the paneer.</li>

    <li>Carefully pour the curdled milk mixture into the cheesecloth-lined colander, allowing the whey to drain into the bowl. Save the whey for other uses if desired.</li>

    <li>Rinse the paneer under cold running water to remove any traces of lemon juice or vinegar. This step is essential to maintain the cheese's taste.</li>

    <li>Gather the corners of the cheesecloth and twist them together to form a bundle. Squeeze gently to remove excess whey from the paneer.</li>

    <li>Place the paneer bundle in the colander, and if you have a heavy object or weights, you can place them on top of the paneer to help press out more whey. Leave it to drain for about 30 minutes to an hour.</li>

    <li>Unwrap the paneer from the cheesecloth and transfer it to a plate. You now have fresh homemade paneer!</li>

    <li>You can use the paneer immediately in your favorite recipes, or you can refrigerate it in an airtight container for later use. Paneer can be used in a variety of dishes like curries, stir-fries, or even desserts.</li>
