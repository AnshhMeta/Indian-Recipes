<h1>Vegetable Biryani Recipe</h1>

<h2>Ingredients:</h2>
<ul>
    <li>1 cup Basmati rice</li>
    <li>2 cups mixed vegetables (e.g., carrots, peas, beans)</li>
    <li>1 large onion, thinly sliced</li>
    <li>2 tomatoes, chopped</li>
    <li>1/4 cup yogurt</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons biryani masala</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon cumin seeds</li>
    <li>2-3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
    <li>1-inch piece of ginger, minced</li>
    <li>2 green chilies, slit</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons cooking oil or ghee</li>
    <li>Salt to taste</li>
    <li>Fresh cilantro and mint leaves for garnish</li>
</ul>

<h2>Instructions:</h2>

<ol>
    <li>Wash the Basmati rice under running water until the water runs clear. Soak the rice in water for 30 minutes, then drain and set aside.</li>

    <li>Heat the cooking oil or ghee in a large heavy-bottomed pan. Add the cumin seeds and let them sizzle for a few seconds.</li>

    <li>Add the sliced onions and sauté them until they turn golden brown.</li>

    <li>Add the minced garlic, ginger, and green chilies. Sauté for another couple of minutes until the raw smell disappears.</li>

    <li>Add the chopped tomatoes and cook until they become soft and the oil starts to separate from the mixture.</li>

    <li>Stir in the biryani masala and cook for a minute to release its flavors.</li>

    <li>Add the mixed vegetables and cook for 2-3 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>

    <li>Now, add the drained Basmati rice and gently stir to mix everything together. Be careful not to break the rice grains.</li>

    <li>Pour in the yogurt and mix well. Add salt to taste.</li>

    <li>Pour 2 cups of water over the rice and vegetables. Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat to low, cover the pan with a tight-fitting lid, and simmer for 15-20 minutes, or until the rice is cooked and the vegetables are tender.</li>

    <li>Once cooked, turn off the heat and let the biryani sit, covered, for 5-10 minutes to allow the flavors to meld.</li>

    <li>Garnish with fresh cilantro and mint leaves before serving.</li>

    <li>Serve the vegetable biryani hot with raita or a side salad.</li>
</ol>
